/*

Objects are a dimension higher than arrays. Despite the similarities it shares with arrays, objects do one fundamental thing
differently – objects store property-value pairs, unlike arrays that store index-value pairs.

Objects are created in a similar fashion to regular variables and arrays.

Properties of objects are enclosed within opening and closing curly braces. Properties are separated by commas and can store
any data type as its value.

// Example Object
var exampleObject = {
  “name” : “Example Object”,
  “type” : “Object”,
  “year_created” : 2020,
  “favoriteColors” : [“Purple”, “Green”, “Blue”]
};

// The properties of the object are strings that precede the colon, and their values follow after the colon. Each property is
// separated by a comma, and the values of the properties are various data types – strings, numbers and even an array.
