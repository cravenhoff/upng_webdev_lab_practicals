/*
  Variables are the most basic form of storage unit in JavaScript (and any other programming language).
  
  Variables allow certain assigned values to be re-used and referenced multiple times throughout a script. Variables can only hold one
  value at a time.
  
  Variables can be created in two ways - variable "declaration" and variable "initialization". All variables in JavaScript are created using
  the "var" keyword, followed by the name of the variable, the assignment operator, and the value of the variable. JavaScript uses
  "Camel Casing" as a standard for naming variables.

// Declaring a variable
var myVariable; // No value is assigned to "myVariable" - By default, it will contain the value of "null".

// Initializing a variable
var anotherVariable = "Hello, world"; // Variables that are initialized have "initial" values assigned to them, as this variable.
