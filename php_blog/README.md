# Basic PHP Blog: CRUD Operations

Basic PHP Blog built from scratch using PHP & MySQL. This application utilizes the common CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) Operations allowing users/visitors to create new blog posts, read from the list of existing posts, update/modify existing posts, and delete posts.

The blog application uses/implements that MYSQLI Database Extension in PHP, and not the PDO Extensions. Further updates and iterations to this application will include the more secure and standard PDO extenion.
