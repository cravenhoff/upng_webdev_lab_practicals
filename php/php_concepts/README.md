# PHP Concepts

Basic concepts introducing the PHP programming language like variables, data types and operators, conditional statements, loops, and functions (including php-specific functions like the date() function and the common php string functions).

Several other files pertain to more web-specific features of PHP, and what makes it one of the most dynamic languages of the web. These include concepts covering HTTP and HTTP request methods, superglobals, sessions and cookies, and back-end processing/connections with a database, in particular with MySQL through the use of both the MYSQLI and PDO (PHP Data Objects) Database Extension of PHP.
