# PHP Course Sign Up Application

Basic PHP & MySQL application that registers or signs students up for courses on offer at the University of PNG (UPNG).

The application contains a list of registered courses, and provides a sign up form that students can use to sign up for available courses. Once students sign up, they will be listed in the database and on the application page.
