# Student Information App: Vanilla JavaScript

A basic app built from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript that dynamically registers and lists students attending university (in this case, UPNG) along with the courses they're taking. The app works solely with an almost blank index.html file, and the browser console for output - the DOM (Document Object Model) is not used.
