# JavaScript Concepts

A beginner's guide to JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript to be exact) that introduces students to the scripting language, how to work with JavaScript, and the foundational constructs of the language such as commenting, variables, common operations - arithmetic, compound assignments, comparison operatators, increment/decrement - data types, strings and bracket notation. Building on this, students look at arrays, functions, conditional statements - if elseif and switch statements - loops, objects, common built-in JavaScript functions, and the ternary operator.
